Hi, I’m Tyler Wallace. I am a biomedical researcher who loves utilizing programming to improve the efficiency of research. 
I’m interested in expanding my data utilization skills to create meaninful improvement for health outcomes. 
I'm always learning but right now it's sharpening my skills in Python and R, while building a new set of skills in SQL.
